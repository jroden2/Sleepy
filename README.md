# Sleepy
Sleepy is a project to create a series of example structures for the creation of HTTP services with RESTful APIs.

These example template/structures will allow the easy design and deployment by following a chosen pattern and framework, each of which have their support networks, documentation (of various qualities) and examples around the internet. This project is an effort to create a central repository to house them all in one place.

## What frameworks?
Currently I have created two examples with others planned, each is linked where possible to their example github/website - Those already ticked have been completed.
 - [x] [Go Vanilla (HTTP package)](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go)
 - [x] [Gin-Gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
 - [ ] [Echo by LabStack](https://github.com/labstack/echo)
 - [ ] [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
